Fig. 1: Banana orbit crossing the separatrix in axisymmetric geometry. Symplectic schemes conserve toroidal momentum exactly and energy within bounds. Settings were such that all integrators used about 2000 field evaluations per bounce period. In this example, explicit-implicit Euler could still increase the step length and therefore reduce these evaluations by factor 3.9 until it reaches its stability limit.
