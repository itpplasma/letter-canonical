  abstract = {The purpose of this review article is to demonstrate via a few simple models the mechanism for a very general, universal instability - the Arnold diffusion---which occurs in the oscillating systems having more than two degrees of freedom. A peculiar feature of this instability results in an irregular, or stochastic, motion of the system as if the latter were influenced by a random perturbation even though, in fact, the motion is governed by purely dynamical equations. The instability takes place generally for very special initial conditions (inside the so-called stochastic layers) which are, however, everywhere dense in the phase space of the systsm. The basic and simplest one of the models considered is that of a pendulum under an external periodic perturbation. This model represents the behavior of nonlinear oscillations near a resonance, including the phenomenon of the stochastic instability within the stochastic layer of resonance. All models are treated both analytically and numerically. Some general regulations concerning the stochastic instability are presented, including a general, semi-quantitative method-the overlap criterion---to estimate the conditions for this stochastic instability as well as its main characteristics.},

  abstract = {A numerical integration method for guiding-center orbits of charged particles in toroidal fusion devices with three-dimensional field geometry is described. Here, high order interpolation of electromagnetic fields in space is replaced by a special linear interpolation, leading to locally linear Hamiltonian equations of motion with piecewise constant coefficients. This approach reduces computational effort and noise sensitivity, while the conservation of total energy, magnetic moment and phase space volume is retained. The underlying formulation treats motion in piecewise linear fields exactly and, thus, preserves the non-canonical symplectic form. The algorithm itself is only quasi-geometric due to a series expansion in the orbit parameter. For practical purposes, an expansion to the fourth order retains geometric properties down to computer accuracy in typical examples. When applied to collisionless guiding-center orbits in an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic three-dimensional stellarator configuration, the method demonstrates stable long-term orbit dynamics conserving invariants. In Monte Carlo evaluation of transport coefficients, the computational efficiency of quasi-geometric integration is an order of magnitude higher than with a standard fourth order Runge--Kutta integrator.},

[Phys. of Plasmas 28, 092505 (2021)] showed that equilibria computed by the Stepped-Pressure Equilibrium Code (SPEC) [Hudson et al., Phys. Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)] could be optimized for good magnetic surfaces in vacuum. In this paper, we build upon their work to show the first finite-{$\beta$}, fixed-, and free-boundary optimization of SPEC equilibria for good magnetic surfaces. The objective function is constructed with the Greene's residue of selected rational surfaces, and the optimization is driven by the SIMSOPT framework [Landreman et al., J. Open Source Software 6, 3525 (2021)]. We show that the size of magnetic islands and the consequent regions occupied by chaotic field lines can be minimized in a classical stellarator geometry (rotating ellipse) by optimizing either the injected toroidal current profile, the shape of a perfectly conducting wall surrounding the plasma (fixed-boundary case), or the vacuum field produced by the coils (free-boundary case). This work shows that SPEC can be used as an equilibrium code both in a two-step or single-step stellarator optimization loop.},

  abstract = {An adjoint method to calculate the gradient of island width in stellarators is presented and applied to a set of magnetic field configurations. The underlying method for calculation of the island width is that of Cary \& Hanson (Phys. Fluids B, vol. 3, issue 4, 1991, pp. 1006--1014) (with a minor modification), and requires that the residue of the island centre be small. Therefore, the gradient of the residue is calculated in addition. Both the island width and the gradient calculations are verified using an analytical magnetic field configuration introduced by Reiman \& Greenside (Comput. Phys. Commun., vol. 43, issue 1, 1986, pp. 157--167). The method is also applied to the calculation of the shape gradient of the width of a magnetic island in a National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) vacuum configuration with respect to positions on a coil. A gradient-based optimization is applied to a magnetic field configuration studied by Hanson \& Cary (Phys. Fluids, vol. 27, issue 4, 1984, pp. 767--769) to minimize stochasticity by adding perturbations to a pair of helical coils. Although only vacuum magnetic fields and an analytical magnetic field model are considered in this work, the adjoint calculation of the island width gradient could also be applied to a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium if the derivative of the magnetic field, with respect to the equilibrium parameters, is known. Using the island width gradient calculation presented here, more general gradient-based optimization methods can be applied to design stellarators with small magnetic islands. Moreover, the sensitivity of the island size may itself be optimized to ensure that coil tolerances, with respect to island size, are kept as high as possible.},

New algorithms were recently developed using the variational integration formalism; however, those integrators were found to admit parasitic mode instabilities due to their multistep character. This work eliminates the multistep character, and therefore the parasitic mode instabilities via an adaptation of the variational integration formalism that we deem ``degenerate variational integration.''

Geometric structures associated with and emergent from HAP formulations are discussed. These include conservative integration, which exactly conserves invariants, symplectic integration, which exactly preserves the Hamiltonian geometric structure, and other Hamiltonian integration techniques. Basic ideas of variational integration and Poisson integration, which can preserve noncanonical Hamiltonian structure, are discussed. Metriplectic integration, which preserves the structure of conservative systems with both Hamiltonian and dissipative parts, is proposed. Two kinds of simulated annealing, a relaxation technique for obtaining equilibrium states, are reviewed: one that uses metriplectic dynamics, which maximizes an entropy at fixed energy, the other that uses double bracket dynamics, which preserves Casimir invariants. Throughout, applications to plasma systems are emphasized. The paper culminates with a discussion of GEMPIC [Kraus et al., arXiv:1609.03053v1 [math.NA] (2016)], a particle in cell code that incorporates Hamiltonian and geometrical structure preserving properties.},

Plasmas 6 153). The second mapping is a canonical mapping near the separatrix which is constructed using the recently developed method (Abdullaev 2004 Phys. Rev. E 70 064202, Abdullaev 2005 Phys. Rev. E 72 064202). We construct the corresponding mappings for magnetic field lines in divertor tokamaks in the presence of non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations. The mappings are applied to study the properties of open stochastic field lines near the separatrix for the wire model of the plasma. Poincare{\textasciiacute} sections, the so-called laminar and magnetic footprint plot (a contour plot of wall to wall connections lengths) in the plasma region and on the divertor plates are obtained.

(1) Even a small toroidal asymmetry in the magnetic field strength, {$\delta$} {$\equiv$} {$\partial$}ln B/{$\partial\varphi$} {$\sim$} 10-4, can cause an unacceptable degradation in performance. (2) Nevertheless, asymmetries---even large asymmetries {$\delta$} {$\sim$} 1---can give beneficial plasma control and circumvent issues, such as magnetic-configuration maintenance and plasma disruptions, that make axisymmetric fusion devices problematic. Viewed from prospectives that are adequate for designing and studying axisymmetric plasmas, the physics of non-axisymmetric plasmas appears dauntingly difficult. Remarkably, Maxwell's equations provide such strong constraints on the physics of toroidal fusion plasmas that even a black-box model of a plasma answers many important questions. Kinetic theory and non-equilibrium thermodynamics provide further, but more nuanced, constraints. This paper is organized so these constraints can be used as a basis for the innovations and for the extrapolations that are required to go from existing experiments to fusion systems. Outlines are given of a number of calculations that would be of great importance to ITER and to the overall fusion program and that could be carried out now with limited resources.},

  abstract = {We present orbit classification schemes for use as fast metrics for fusion alpha particle losses implemented in the symplectic guiding-centre code SIMPLE. Two variants respectively based on conservation of the parallel adiabatic invariant, and topology of footprints in Poincar{\'e} sections are introduced. Like an existing approach based on the Minkowski fractal dimension, those methods estimate whether a guiding-centre orbit is regular and therefore expected to be confined for infinite time in the collisionless case, or chaotic, which might lead to its loss. Compared with the existing approach, the required orbit tracing time for the novel classifiers is shorter by at least an order of magnitude. This enables massive sampling of orbits across the whole phase space to identify regular and chaotic regions for the purpose stellarator optimization. Based on conservation of the perpendicular invariant, we demonstrate how extended regular regions may act as radial barriers for orbits from the chaotic regions on the radially inboard side. We propose to use a quantified version of this property as a new metric for collisionless fusion alpha losses. As pitch-angle scattering becomes only relevant after alphas have already deposited a significant fraction of their energy, such a metric remains useful also for the case with collisions. This is illustrated by comparison with collisional loss computations. Results are presented for applications to two quasi-isodynamic configurations, a quasi-helical configuration and two quasi-axisymmetric configurations. In addition, the Hamiltonian action-angle formalism is used in quasi-axisymmetric configurations to investigate the overlap of drift-orbit resonances leading to chaos. The respective analysis is performed with the NEO-RT code originally developed for investigation of neoclassical toroidal viscous torque in tokamak plasmas.},

Because the parallel component of this field can vanish, there is a range of parallel velocities where the Lagrangian guiding center equations of motion are either ill-defined or very badly behaved. Moreover, the velocity dependence of B* greatly complicates the identification of canonical variables and therefore the formulation of symplectic integrators for guiding center dynamics. This letter introduces a simple coordinate transformation that alleviates both these problems simultaneously. In the new coordinates, the Liouville volume element is equal to the toroidal contravariant component of the magnetic field. Consequently, the large-velocity singularity is completely eliminated. Moreover, passing from the new coordinate system to canonical coordinates is extremely simple, even if the magnetic field is devoid of flux surfaces. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in regularizing the guiding center Lagrangian by presenting a new and stable one-step variational integrator for guiding centers moving in arbitrary time-dependent electromagnetic fields.},

We analyse the properties of the resulting algorithms, in particular with respect to the conservation of energy, momentum maps and symplecticity. In numerical experiments, we verify the favourable properties of the projected integrators and demonstrate their excellent long-time fidelity. In particular, we consider a two-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system, planar point vortices with position-dependent circulation and guiding centre dynamics.},

This discovery overcomes the difficulty associated with the unstable parasitic modes for variational symplectic integrators when applied to the degenerate guiding center Lagrangian. It is a pleasant surprise that Pauli's Hamiltonian for electrons, which predated the Dirac equation and marks the beginning of particle physics, reappears in classical physics as an effective algorithm for solving an important plasma physics problem.

  abstract = {The classical Pauli particle (CPP) serves as a slow manifold, substituting the conventional guiding center dynamics. Based on the CPP, we utilize the averaged vector field (AVF) method in the computations of drift orbits. Demonstrating significantly higher efficiency, this advanced method is capable of accomplishing the simulation in less than one-third of the time of directly computing the guiding center motion. In contrast to the CPP-based Boris algorithm, this approach inherits the advantages of the AVF method, yielding stable trajectories even achieved with a tenfold time step and reducing the energy error by two orders of magnitude. By comparing these two CPP algorithms with the traditional RK4 method, the numerical results indicate a remarkable performance in terms of both the computational efficiency and error elimination. Moreover, we verify the properties of slow manifold integrators and successfully observe the bounce on both sides of the limiting slow manifold with deliberately chosen perturbed initial conditions. To evaluate the practical value of the methods, we conduct simulations in non-axisymmetric perturbation magnetic fields as part of the experiments, demonstrating that our CPP-based AVF method can handle simulations under complex magnetic field configurations with high accuracy, which the CPP-based Boris algorithm lacks. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the CPP can replace guiding center dynamics in using energy-preserving algorithms for computations, providing a new, efficient, as well as stable approach for applying structure-preserving algorithms in plasma simulations.},

We prove that such systems also admit nearly invariant manifolds of each order, near which rapid oscillations are suppressed. We study the nonlinear normal stability of these slow manifolds for nearly periodic Hamiltonian systems on barely symplectic manifolds---manifolds equipped with closed, non-degenerate 2-forms that may be degenerate to leading order. In particular, we establish a sufficient condition for long-term normal stability based on second derivatives of the well-known adiabatic invariant. We use these results to investigate the problem of embedding guiding center dynamics of a magnetized charged particle as a slow manifold in a nearly periodic system. We prove that one previous embedding and two new embeddings enjoy long-term normal stability and thereby strengthen the theoretical justification for these models.},

Furthermore, higher order energy-preserving methods are systematically introduced by using a composition technique. Two second order and two fourth order symmetric energy-preserving methods are constructed and applied to simulate the guiding center motion in both the dipole magnetic field and the tokamak magnetic field. Numerical results show that these methods have significant superiorities in energy conservation compared with the existing canonicalized symplectic methods of the corresponding orders. The numerical case of the guiding center motion in the toroidal acceleration electric field exhibits favorable long-term conservative properties of the new methods to the particle-field system, while the kinetic energy of guiding centers keeps increasing. These energy-preserving methods based on the averaged vector field can be applied to any non-canonical Hamiltonian system.},

A radially inhomogeneous periodic cylindrical plasma with a rotational transform of the magnetic field is studied with parameters relevant to the dynamic ergodic divertor (DED) of TEXTOR. For the case of a finite electron diamagnetic velocity it is shown that the torque resulting from the RMF tends to bring the electron fluid approximately to the rest frame of this field. This result is in qualitative agreement with long mean-free path drift MHD theory. In contrast to that theory where a resonant behaviour is found at electron and ion diamagnetic frequencies, in the present kinetic analysis, the RMF frequency where the torque passes through zero is smaller than the electron diamagnetic frequency if there is an electron temperature gradient present. The relation of these results with recent experimental measurements of the DED-induced plasma rotation in TEXTOR is discussed.},

  abstract = {An important difference between the classical collision operator, C(f), and Kaufman's quasi-linear diffusion operator in action space, D(f), is that only the former conserves particles, momentum, and energy at each spatial point. The nonlocal character of action-space diffusion allows all transport fluxes to be expressed directly in terms of appropriate moments of D. Thus, a general description of quasi-linear diffusion and convection across flux surfaces in any collisionless, axisymmetric toroidal system is obtained, in terms of scale factors relating the invariant surfaces to the flux surfaces. Several analogues to the neoclassical problem are apparent, including the collisionless version of the Ware--Galeev pinch effect, whose derivation in action space is especially straightforward. Toroidicity modifies not only particle orbits but also the spatial structure of the fluctuations, and both modifications affect the resulting transport in an important way. The use of appropriate action-angle variables automatically includes the orbital effects; crucial features of the toroidal eignmode structure are incorporated by use of the ballooning representation. This makes the fastest radial variation explicit, in terms of a single parameter describing the degree to which submodes localized on different rational surfaces overlap. The variation on slower length scales, and the overall spectral amplitude, are not determined. The radial particle flux corresponding to a Maxwellian distribution function is displayed and its dependence on properties of the spectrum is analyzed.},

Careful placement of planar control coils and the incorporation of an integrability objective enhance the quasisymmetry and nested flux surface volume of each configuration. We show that it is possible to achieve flexibility, quasisymmetry, and nested flux surface volume to reasonable degrees with a relatively simple coil set through an NCSX-like example. This example coil design is optimized to achieve three rotational transform targets and nested flux surface volumes in each magnetic configuration larger than the NCSX design plasma volume.
